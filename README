mfgen.pl - a Perl script to generate makefiles to encode audio to different formats.
(C)2006-2011, Dan Ponte <amigan@gmail.com>

Rationale:
Generating makefiles allows you to use make -j, which allows you to utilize multiple CPUs in an SMP configuration to
encode more than one file at once.

Help:

usage: mfgen.pl [-hmMOR] [-y year] [-g genre] [-A artist] [-L album] [-d disc#] [-p path]
